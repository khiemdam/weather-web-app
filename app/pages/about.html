            <p>Hello, my name is Khiem Dam. I am a Junior at the University of Michigan, and I am studying Computer Science, seeking my first software engineering internship. I am excited to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer.
                One of my interests is learning new things, and web development seemed pretty cool.
                This is my first ever web application, and I hope I look back on this and see how much I've improved. 
                I used HTML to create this website!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                During my free time, I find it fun looking into different fields of CS through personal projects, some of which include a web application, robots and LED controls, and video games (all from scratch!). No matter the area, I really enjoy learning new things and deploying my problem solving skills that I have worked hard on improving.
            </p>

                I have also had many experiences working on team projects, where I often miss the dynamics of my groups. Being a part of multiple teams allowed me to work on my knowledge of GitHub, and also communicating effectively to clarify and delegate tasks. I've learned many lessons as a member of project teams, and as the Logistics chair for the Vietnamese Student Association culture show at UofM.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am proficient in C++, C, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am looking for opportunities to expand upon the skills that I have gained from my education and experiences. My goals are to use the knowledge I've gained to learn more and to make a positive impact in the world. I aspire to make a difference in the field as I learn more about software development.
